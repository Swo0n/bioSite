            My name is Ken Taylor, and I am from Ohio, in the midwestern part of the United States. I enjoy hiking, swimming, and karaoke outside my typical hobbies. Games are a significant portion of my life, whether, I am making games or playing them.<br><br>

            <span>What more do you need in your life?</span><br>

            If I had a day where I could do anything, I would travel to Africa or Brazil. It is a dream of mine to see the African Savanah and the Amazon rainforest in those locations. I would love to go to either of these places to observe all the animals in their natural habitats.<br><br>
